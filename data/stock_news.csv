AUTO|F|2017-07-19 08:53:37|cnbc.com|https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/19/jpmorgan-asset-management-us-dollar-will-rebound-in-second-half-of-2017.html|The US dollar will rebound in the second half of 2017, says JPMorgan|The current weakness in the U.S. dollar may be short lived, as a pick-up in inflation and expected rate hikes by the Federal Reserve will support the greenback in the coming months, JPMorgan Asset Management said Wednesday. "We're thinking that the dollar will actually rebound in the second half, and this is mainly as the markets re-price in interest rates hike. We're of the view that inflation will actually be picking up in the U.S. and currently, markets have only priced in one rate hike now till end-2018," Jasslyn Yeo, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC's "Street Signs." "So, we think (markets) are going to do a bit of re-pricing and that will support a bit of a rebound in the dollar," she added. The U.S. dollar tumbled to a 10-month low on Tuesday after the Republican health-care bill aimed at replacing Obamacare failed to get enough backing to proceed to a debate. Some market observers have said that a weaker dollar can help to boost earnings of S&P 500 companies and eventually justify their high valuations. But Yeo said equity markets outside the U.S., such as Europe and Japan, have more upside potential. Yeo noted that margins in Europe are starting to improve and that could translate into stronger earnings growth, while Japan is likely to benefit from a weaker yen versus the U.S. dollar. "We still like certain spots in the U.S. market. Currently we still favor U.S. banks, which we like in terms of rate hike expectations, bond yields moving higher as well as the promise for financial deregulation in the banking system," she said. "Purely from a valuation play we think that U.S. valuations are more challenging at the moment and investors should be looking to diversify out of the U.S. to other various markets."

AUTO|F|2017-07-18 13:26:41|http://www.nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/harley-davidson-hog-shares-cross-3-yield-mark-cm817734|Harley-Davidson (HOG) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark|Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel , in trading on Tuesday, shares of Harley-Davidson Inc (Symbol: HOG) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.46), with the stock changing hands as low as $46.00 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Harley-Davidson Inc (Symbol: HOG) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Harley-Davidson Inc, looking at the history chart for HOG below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, HOG makes up 2.46% of the First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund ETF (Symbol: CARZ) which is trading lower by about 0.6% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.This article appears in: Investing , Options
AUTO|RACE|2016-11-13 08:53:37|nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-auto-investors-are-worried-about-the-united-states-cm708299|Why Auto Investors Are Worried About the United States|Shares of the Detroit automakers have had a tough ride in 2016. Year to date, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) shares are down almost 13%, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles '(NYSE: FCAU) are down nearly 17%.General Motors '(NYSE: GM) shares are about flat for the year, but only because a sharp rally on Thursday and Friday erased its losses. Through this past Wednesday, GM's stock was down about 9% since the beginning of 2016.It doesn't seem fair. All three have reported strong profits in recent quarters. But investors have been worried about the U.S. new-car market, which accounts for the bulk of Detroit's profits -- and which is showing signs of slowing down.Strong truck and SUV sales have generated fat profits for Detroit over the last few years. Image source: Ford Motor Company.North America is extremely important to Detroit's bottom linesGM, Ford, and FCA are all global companies with huge operations around the world. But all three, more so than most of their global rivals, are still very dependent on profits in North America, most of which come from the United States.Data sources: the automakers' earnings reports. Chart shows adjusted pre-tax profits in North America (blue) as a percentage of overall pre-tax profits (blue plus green) for 2016 through Sept. 30. FCA's results have been converted from euros to U.S. dollars at a rate of 1 euro = $1.09.That makes the state of the U.S. new-car market very important to investors in the Detroit automakers. And as I said, there are growing signs that it may be past its cyclical peak.As U.S. sales go, so do Detroit's profitsAuto sales are cyclical. Demand for new cars and trucks is closely correlated with consumer confidence, for reasons that are probably obvious: People and businesses hold off on buying new vehicles when they're concerned that their earnings are going to be squeezed.The pace of auto sales is tracked using a calculated statistic called the "SAAR," for "seasonally adjusted annualized rate." If we say that the SAAR for October 2016 was 17.65 million, it means that if the pace of auto sales we saw in October were maintained for a full calendar year, 17.65 million vehicles would be sold that year.There are several different calculations of SAAR. The most important one for our purposes is the one that shows the pace of U.S. sales of "light vehicles," meaning cars, pickups, and SUVs. This chart shows the SAAR for the past three years.The pace of sales can vary considerably from month to month, but the trend isn't too hard to see: While it's still very strong by historical standards, the pace of light-vehicle sales in the U.S. peaked late in 2015 and has fallen off since.This longer-term chart, showing mostly SAAR figures all the way back to the beginning of 2000, might make the picture more clear.U.S. light-vehicle sales plateaued from 2000 through 2006, fell off a cliff in 2008, and didn't really recover to pre-recession levels until 2014. They went a little higher in 2015 and have slipped back a bit in 2016.What does it mean if the auto sales cycle is past its peak?As last decade's data shows, if the economy is reasonably strong, auto sales can stay at a plateau for several years. That might be how things play out this time. But there are signs that automakers are starting to scrounge for sales growth by boosting their incentives. That's not an encouraging sign for investors, as rising incentives tend to eat into profit margins.There are other signs. Just in the past few weeks, both Ford and GM have announced production cuts . They were modest ones, but production cuts of any kind aren't something we'd expect to see in a growing market.For long-term investors, there's no reason to panic: A cyclical sales decline is normal and inevitable. But it's worth keeping in mind that as sales in North America taper off, profits at the Detroit automakers are likely to come under pressure for a while.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Ford Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

AUTO|RACE|2016-11-12 05:37:27|nasdaq.com|http://www.nasdaq.com/article/donald-trump-and-the-stock-market-did-you-miss-these-moves-cm708221|Donald Trump and the Stock Market: Did You Miss These Moves?|I've decided that the markets are similar to small children: Just when you believe you have them figured out, they zig when you anticipate a zag. Donald Trump shocked the nation with his surprise victory earlier this week, and Dow futures abruptly dropped roughly 850 points -- more than the drop after the events of 9/11. Then, something crazy happened. That decline abruptly reversed in the morning hours, and throughout the week, enabling the Dow to post its largest weekly gain since 2011. Raise your hand if you saw that coming? Go ahead; I'll wait.While there's a huge amount of uncertainty attached to Trump's upcoming presidency, we should all remember to avoid knee-jerk reactions, because you just never know when the market will zig instead of zag. Sticking with the Trump theme, here are some companies making big headlines or big moves this week.Fiat Chrysler's Trump cardThe auto industry can't catch a break this year, with Brexit throwing a curveball in Europe and sales peaking in the U.S. market. Now, Trump has mentioned a couple of strings he might yank that could complicate things for multiple major automakers.Trump mentioned potentially adding tariffs to vehicles exported from Mexico to the U.S., which would make it more expensive for Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors to produce small cars in Mexico and bring them to the states. Some estimate (take it with a grain of salt) that the additional cost could reach $5,000 per vehicle. Despite that negative prediction, automakers largely rebounded this week for one reason: likely relaxed emissions standards. And that left Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) in the dust, watching other automakers surge higher.TSLA Price data by YCharts .The story is simple: Trump plans to complete a comprehensive review of all federal regulations, especially the fuel economy and emissions standards. The belief is that the emissions standards, set to require fleets to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, will be relaxed significantly.Tesla's Model S. Image source: Tesla Motors.That would hinder demand for electric vehicles, which Tesla solely focuses on, and enable Detroit automakers to focus more on larger vehicles. "We cannot see this in a positive light for Tesla," said Morgan Stanley 's Adam Jonas, speaking in regards to the election results, according to Barron's . "An environment that moves away from incentivizing electric vehicles is clearly adverse to the story."That's also why Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) jumped the highest this week. It benefited the most since it was drastically behind the industry in terms of developing electric vehicles or hybrids and still heavily relies on Jeep and Ram Truck for profits.Defense and industrials stocks surgeI'll refrain from quoting any of Trump's speeches, but it's pretty clear if you heard him over the course of his campaign that defense companies are poised to benefit -- and that was certainly reflected in the markets this week.RTN Price data by YCharts .Morningstar even took a broad brush to its price targets for defense companies: "Our new fair value estimates are as follows: General Dynamics $168 (from $155), Raytheon $151 ($144), L-3 Communications $145 ($138), Northrop Grumman $208 ($192), Lockheed Martin $224 ($221), and Boeing $151 ($145)."Image source: Getty Images.Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) had an even better week as it secured a contract from the U.S. Air Force to provide vehicles and support equipment for Lot 10 Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammer, or MALD-J. The contract is valued at just over $76 million.In terms of industrials, Trump's victory was a huge boon for U.S. Concrete (NASDAQ: USCR) ; its stock price jumped 17% for the week. It's not difficult to understand why, either. U.S. Concrete generates almost 60% of its revenues from selling products in the commercial and industrial construction business, and another 16% from street, highway, and other public projects.Both of those segments stand to benefit from Trump's promised infrastructure spending, especially the latter. Beyond that, it's even more encouraging for investors of U.S. Concrete because the company operates most of its business in critical markets such as New York; New Jersey; Washington, D.C.; Northern California; and Texas.Even better yet, the company's business revolves around selling ready-mix concrete and aggregates to construction companies, so it's a less risky play since the company doesn't have to win contracts to benefit from massive infrastructure spending.Ultimately, these are just a couple of the sectors that were impacted significantly this week thanks to Trump's surprise victory. But we all need to remember that he doesn't take office until January, and we don't know for sure how quickly his policy changes will happen or how broad they will be.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than US Concrete Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.
